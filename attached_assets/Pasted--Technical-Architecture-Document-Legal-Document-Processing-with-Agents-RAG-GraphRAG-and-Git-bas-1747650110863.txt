# Technical Architecture Document: Legal Document Processing with Agents, RAG, GraphRAG, and Git-based Versioning

## 1. Overview

This document defines the technical architecture for a system designed to process, analyze, and version legal documents (e.g., laws, regulations, amendments) using advanced NLP agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), GraphRAG, and Git-based version control.

Target jurisdiction: Republic of Kazakhstan
Primary language: Russian
Deployment: Air-gapped/private environment using open-source LLMs

## 2. Objectives

* Ingest and structure legal documents using standardized formats
* Enable automated semantic search and comparison across legal texts
* Track and manage versions of legislation using Git-like workflows
* Empower AI agents to perform specialized legal tasks reliably
* Ensure explainability and auditability of all AI outputs

## 3. System Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Core Layers

* **Data Ingestion Layer**: PDF, DOCX, or HTML legal documents
* **Transformation Layer**: Converts raw documents into XML/JSON (e.g., Akoma Ntoso format)
* **Knowledge Representation Layer**:

  * Graph-based Knowledge Base (Neo4j, RDF/OWL)
  * Vector store for semantic chunk search (e.g., Weaviate, Milvus)
* **Agent Orchestration Layer**: Task-specific agents managed through LangChain/AgentSmith-like framework
* **Interface Layer**: Web dashboard and API for users (legislators, analysts, developers)

---

## 4. Data Pipeline

### 4.1 Ingestion

* Input formats: PDF, DOCX, HTML
* OCR: For scanned documents (Tesseract + layout parsers)
* Metadata extraction: Document title, article numbers, publication dates

### 4.2 Normalization

* Convert to **Akoma Ntoso** XML format
* Normalize legal terms using a controlled vocabulary (Kazakh legal taxonomy)
* Store original and normalized forms

### 4.3 Chunking

* Break documents into semantically meaningful chunks:

  * Articles
  * Paragraphs
  * Sentences
* Attach metadata: source, date, jurisdiction, version ID

### 4.4 Indexing

* **Vector embeddings** (e.g., Mistral / LLaMA + Sentence Transformers)
* **Graph entities**: Create nodes/edges for:

  * Legal entities (laws, institutions)
  * Normative roles (obligations, permissions, prohibitions)
  * Concepts and definitions

## 5. Agent Design (LLM-Oriented Modular Agents)

| Agent Name              | Task Description                                           | Tools Used                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **DocParserAgent**      | Parse raw documents to structured XML                      | PDF parsers, Tika, Akoma Ntoso normalizer   |
| **TermAlignAgent**      | Align terminology to official legal taxonomy               | SPARQL over OWL ontology + embedding lookup |
| **VectorizerAgent**     | Embed structured chunks for semantic search                | LLM embeddings + FAISS/Milvus               |
| **GraphBuilderAgent**   | Extract entities & relations for graph population          | Named Entity Recognition, Neo4j API         |
| **VersionControlAgent** | Commit and diff legislative changes via Git-like system    | Git CLI/API + YAML/JSON/XML versioned files |
| **ComplianceAgent**     | Compare new law against existing legislation for conflicts | GraphRAG + logical rule checker             |
| **ExplainerAgent**      | Generate chain-of-thought explanation for decisions        | Chain-of-thought + RAG citation retriever   |
| **SummarizerAgent**     | Produce summaries of legal documents                       | LLM summarization over chunked text         |

## 6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 6.1 Standard RAG Flow

1. User submits question or new legal draft
2. Query is vectorized → top-k chunks retrieved from vector DB
3. Context and query passed to LLM for generation
4. LLM outputs answer + citation links to chunks

### 6.2 GraphRAG Extension

* Combine RAG with **Graph-based querying**
* Graph path lookup → legal reasoning chain
* Use structured data (ontology paths) to verify logic of outputs
* Display graph-paths alongside generated answer

---

## 7. Git-based Legal Versioning

### 7.1 Structure

* Store legal texts in `Akoma Ntoso` or structured Markdown format
* Directory structure: `/laws/<jurisdiction>/<year>/<law_name>/`
* Use Git for commits, diffs, authorship, branches

### 7.2 Semantic Diffing

* Specialized diff engine to detect changes in:

  * Terms and definitions
  * Obligations and permissions
  * Cross-references
* Agent-assisted diff explanations (natural language summary of change impact)

---

## 8. Explainability and Trust

* Trace all answers to **source document fragments**
* Display inline links to paragraphs used
* Use **Chain-of-Thought prompting** for legal reasoning
* Enable toggling between LLM output and formal legal logic trace

## 9. Deployment Stack

| Component       | Technology                                |
